      description: Use Azure Config Server for externalized configuration management
  message: |
    The application uses hardcoded paths and environment-specific values in configuration files.

    Hardcoded paths in configuration files can cause issues when:
    - Deploying to containers where file system paths are different
    - Running in cloud environments where local file system access is restricted
    - Scaling the application across multiple instances
    - Managing different environments (dev, test, prod)
    - Implementing container health checks
    - Configuring container resource limits

    Recommendation:
    - Use environment variables for all configuration
    - Implement a configuration server (e.g., Azure Config Server)
    - Use cloud-native configuration management
    - Implement container-aware configuration validation
    - Add runtime configuration checks
    - Use secrets management for sensitive data

  message: |
    The application uses file-based storage with direct filesystem access.

    File-based storage can cause issues when:
    - Deploying to containers where file system access is restricted
    - Running in cloud environments where local storage is ephemeral
    - Scaling the application across multiple instances
    - Managing data consistency across instances
    - Implementing container data persistence
    - Handling container restarts
    - Managing container volumes
    - Implementing data backup and recovery

    Recommendation:
    - Use a proper database service (e.g., Azure Database)
    - Implement proper transaction management
    - Use cloud-native storage solutions
    - Implement container-aware data access patterns
    - Add proper data validation
    - Use connection pooling
    - Implement retry mechanisms

  message: |
    The application uses file-based logging with local file system access.

    File-based logging can cause issues when:
    - Deploying to containers where file system access is restricted
    - Running in cloud environments where local storage is ephemeral
    - Managing logs across multiple instances
    - Implementing log rotation and retention
    - Debugging container issues
    - Monitoring container health
    - Analyzing container performance

    Recommendation:
    - Use container stdout/stderr for logging
    - Implement structured logging (JSON format)
    - Use cloud-native logging solutions
    - Add container-specific log context
    - Implement log correlation across containers
    - Use container-aware log levels

    The application contains code style practices that hinder containerization and cloud deployment.

    Legacy code style practices can cause issues with:
    - Container orchestration and scaling
    - Error handling in distributed environments
    - Configuration management in containers
    - Log aggregation and monitoring
    - Health check implementation
    - Graceful shutdown handling

    Recommendation:
    - Implement container-aware error handling
    - Use environment variables for configuration
    - Add proper health check endpoints
    - Implement graceful shutdown hooks
    - Follow 12-factor app principles
    - Enable automated container testing
