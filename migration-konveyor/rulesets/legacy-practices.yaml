  message: |
    The application uses hardcoded paths in configuration files, which is problematic for containerization and cloud deployment.

    Hardcoded paths in configuration files can cause issues when:
    - Deploying to containers where file system paths are different
    - Running in cloud environments where local file system access is restricted
    - Scaling the application across multiple instances

    Recommendation:
    - Use environment variables for configuration
    - Implement a configuration server (e.g., Azure Config Server)
    - Use cloud-native configuration management solutions

    builtin.file:
      pattern: ".*\\.properties$"

  message: |
    The application uses file-based storage with direct filesystem access, which is problematic for containerization and cloud deployment.

    File-based storage can cause issues when:
    - Deploying to containers where file system access is restricted
    - Running in cloud environments where local storage is ephemeral
    - Scaling the application across multiple instances
    - Managing data consistency across instances

    Recommendation:
    - Use a proper database service (e.g., Azure Database)
    - Implement proper transaction management
    - Use cloud-native storage solutions

  message: |
    The application uses file-based logging with local file system access, which is problematic for containerization and cloud deployment.

    File-based logging can cause issues when:
    - Deploying to containers where file system access is restricted
    - Running in cloud environments where local storage is ephemeral
    - Managing logs across multiple instances
    - Implementing log rotation and retention

    Recommendation:
    - Use container stdout/stderr for logging
    - Implement structured logging (JSON format)
    - Use cloud-native logging solutions

    The application demonstrates legacy code style practices that may impact maintainability and cloud readiness.

    Legacy code style practices can cause issues with:
    - Code maintainability
    - Team collaboration
    - Automated testing
    - Code review efficiency

    Recommendation:
    - Follow Google Style Guide compliance
    - Implement consistent import ordering
    - Add comprehensive documentation
    - Use standard 2-space indentation
    - Limit lines to 100 characters
    - Enable automated style checking
